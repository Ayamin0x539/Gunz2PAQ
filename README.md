 PseudoAutoQuester: A dll that makes Gunz 2 memory edits.

VERSION 2.07
--------------

**[FEATURES]**
- Compatibility with Cyanide. You can inject this with Cyanide. Actually, it's meant to be used with Cyanide. I purposefully made it so the hotkeys wouldn't conflict.
- Infinite Ammo
- Infinite z-bar (hit something/get hit first and it'll jump up)
- No cooldown on special z-bar skills
- Monster vacuum in quests (and multiplayer if you're host... it's VERY noticeable though)
- Only supports the second quest map
- Teleportation to rally points
- Up/down teleportation (hilariously not working) - actually, this is fixed.
- Plays a C major progression upon activation
- Plays a C minor progression upon deactivation
